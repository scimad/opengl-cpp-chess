Notes from the code:

* ^1 :

i.e. where you create, where you assin, how you retain the pointer variable is still valid
if the window is created appropriately (e.g. w.r.t GLEWInit(), glfwMakeContextCurrent(window), etc
For now it works, but might need to use glfwSetWindowUserPointer(), glfwGetWindowUserPointer()
